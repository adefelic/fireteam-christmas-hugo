here's a map of all of the native trees in boston!
data comes Analyze Boston's [Treekeeper Street Trees dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/treekeeper-street-trees).

i'm defining "native" as meaning native to new england (not just boston or massachuesetts) and not a cultivar. my sources for determining nativity are a mix of [Donald Leopold's __Native Plants of the Northeast__](https://archive.org/details/nativeplantsofno0000leop), the [Native Plant Trust GoBotany Database](https://gobotany.nativeplanttrust.org/), the [USDA PLANTS Database](https://plants.usda.gov/) and sometimes wikipedia.
