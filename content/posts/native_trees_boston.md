here's a map of all of the native trees in boston!
data comes from Analyze Boston's [Treekeeper Street Trees dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/treekeeper-street-trees). code is at [github.com/adefelic/boston_trees](https://github.com/adefelic/boston_trees).

i'm defining "native" as meaning native to new england (not just boston or massachusetts) and not a cultivar. my sources for determining nativity are a mix of [Donald Leopold's __Native Plants of the Northeast__](https://archive.org/details/nativeplantsofno0000leop), the [Native Plant Trust GoBotany Database](https://gobotany.nativeplanttrust.org/), the [USDA PLANTS Database](https://plants.usda.gov/) and sometimes wikipedia.
