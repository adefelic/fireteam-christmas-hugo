i've gotten farther but not substantially. what has happened:

1. there are more "zones" in the environments
2. there are more encounters, different ones in different zones.
3. different zones have different colors
4. different zones have different music
5. oh and there's a sort of non functional paper doll screen that's actually-functionally loading in some assets.

that's about it. while i'm listing things, i will share that progress has slowed for these two reasons:

1. the game now takes up enough space that i need to think about memory banking. gonna need to refactor everything so that banking is taken into consideration. onerous! so far this looks like it wilkl result in a single giga-commit as it's sort of all-or-nothing. the game will crash quickly from a bad access or run just fine.
2. i went back to college for a semester to finish an old computer science degree, now that i've decided i mostly want out of the software industry. it's a lot of commuting and work and altogether takes most of my executive functioning to do. sry game ;(

on the bright side taking some steps away has allowed me to stew a bit more on what the game's premise could be and i think i'm liking what i've thought up so far. i think it will be based off of a dream i had once that i will call "night road dream".

here are some pictures of the game to leave you with:
