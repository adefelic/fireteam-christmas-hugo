since last october i've been learning gameboy development using the [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) assembler package. this -- plus not being employed after the farming season had ended -- lead quickly to my latest and current project: designing and writing a game in sm83 from scratch (it grows more and more clear that i am cursed to do things this way).

it is tentatively (permanently?) titled "Cetus".

my intent is for it to be a non-violent dungeon crawler with mysterious vibes, good colors, and music to bob your head to. we'll see how that goes.

here are some screenshots of how it looks today:
